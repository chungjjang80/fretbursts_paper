\subsection{Timestamps and burst data}
\label{sec:burststimes}

Beyond providing prepackaged functions for established methods, 
FRETBursts also provides the infrastructure for exploring new analysis approaches.
Users can easily get timestamps (or selection masks) for any photon stream.
Core burst data (essentially start and stop times, indexes 
and derived quantities for each burst) are stored in a \verb|Bursts| object 
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burstsearch.html}{link}).
This object provides a simple and well-tested interface (100 \% unit-test coverage) 
to access and manipulate burst data. \verb|Bursts| are created from a sequence of start/stop 
times and indexes, while all the other fields are automatically
computed. \verb|Bursts|'s methods allow to recompute indexes relative to a different photon
selection or recompute start and stop times relative to a new timestamps array.
Additional methods perform fusion of nearby bursts or combination of two set of bursts 
(time intersection or union). This functionality is used for example to implement 
the DCBS).
In conclusion, \verb|Bursts| efficiently implements all the common operations performed 
with burst data, providing and easy-to-use interface and well tested algorithms. 
Leveraging \verb|Bursts| methods, users can implement new types of analysis without 
wasting time implementing (and debugging) standard manipulation routines.
Examples of working directly with timestamps, masks (i.e. photon selections) and 
burst data are provided in one of the FRETBursts notebooks (\href{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Example%20-%20Working%20with%20timestamps%20and%20bursts.ipynb}{link}). 
Section~\ref{sec:bva} provides a complete example on using FRETBurts to implement 
custom burst analysis techniques.

\paragraph{Python details}
Timestamps are stored in the \verb|Data| attribute \verb|ph_times_m|, which is a list
or arrays, one array per excitation spot. In single-spot measurements the full
timestamps array is accessed as \verb|Data.ph_times_m[0]|. To get  timestamps
of arbitrary photon streams, users can use the method \verb|Data.get_ph_times|
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html?highlight=get_ph_times#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.get_ph_times}{link}).
Photon streams are selected from the full (all-photon) timestamps array using
boolean masks. The masks can be obtained using the method \verb|Data.get_ph_mask|
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html?highlight=get_ph_mask#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.get_ph_mask}{link}).
\verb|Bursts| objects 
(\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/burstsearch.html}{link})
internally store the start and stop times and indexes in a numpy array.
The other fields are computed on-fly using class properties, so they are always
up to date even if start and stop are modified. Iteration over \verb|Bursts| is
relatively fast, with performances similar to iterating through numpy rows.
