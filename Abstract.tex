Single-molecule FRET experiments allows to probe the distance between two fluorescent labels (\textit{donor} and \textit{acceptor}) on the 3-10nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free to diffuse in a solution. When a molecule crosse the excitation volume it emits a burst of photons that can be detected by single-photon detectors (SPADs). In a nutshell, assessing the relative intesity of the donor and acceptor signal in each bursts it allows to infer their distance. smFRET experiments permit to study binding-unbunding processs or conformational changes of biomolecules and have proven to be an unvaluable tool in studying fundamental cellular processes \cite{Kapanidis_2006}.

The concentration must be low enough that only one molecule a time will cross the extitation region. When a molecule crosses and a single or multiple excitation volumensFRETBursts is an opensource python package for data analysys of single-molecule FRET experiments in confocal geometry. FRETBursts can analyze.
