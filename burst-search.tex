\subsubsection{Introduction to burst search}
\label{sec:burstsearch_intro}

After background estimation, the burst search is the next fundamental step of
the analysis. The core "sliding window" algorithm, proposed by
Eggeling~\textit{et al.} in 1998~\cite{Eggeling_1998}, involves searching for
bursts of photons
in which $m$ consecutive photons are contained within a minimal time period
$\Delta t$. In other words, bursts are portions of the photon stream where the
local rate (computed using $m$ photons) is above a minimal rate chosen as a
threshold. Eggeling did not provide any criteria on how to choose the rate
threshold and the number of photons $m$ and as therefore it has become a common
practice to manually tweak those parameters for each specific measurement. 

A more general approach consist in taking into account the background rate of
the specific measurements and in choosing a rate threshold that is $F$ times
larger than the background rate. This approach assures that the resulting bursts
all have a single-to-background ratio (SBR) larger than
$(F-1)$~\cite{Michalet_2012}. A consistent criterion to choose the threshold is
very important when comparing different measurements with different background
rates, when the background significantly changes during the measurements or in
multi-spot measurements where each spot has a different background rate.

A second important aspect of burst search is which photon stream is processed.
Sometimes, for instance when identifying FRET populations, one would like to
apply the burst search to all the photons. Other times, when focusing on
donor-only or acceptor only populations, it is better to use only the donor or
acceptor signal. In general one would like to be able to apply the burst search
to an arbitrary selection of photons. In FRETBursts this can be achieved passing
the appropriate \verb|Ph_sel| object to the burst search method (see
section~\ref{sec:ph_streams} for more info on photon stream definitions).

Finally, Nir~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Nir_2006} proposed a dual-channel burst
search (DCBS) that allows one to mitigate (to some extent) artifacts due to
photo-physical effects such as blinking. In this case a search is performed
independently on two photon streams and bursts are marked only when both photon
streams exhibit a rate higher than the threshold, 
implementing a kind of an AND-gate logic. 
Usually, the term DCBS is refers to a burst search where the two photon streams
are all the photons 
during donor excitation (\verb|Ph_sel(Dex='DAem')|) and acceptor channel photons
during acceptor 
excitation (\verb|Ph_sel(Aex='Aem')|).

After the first level of burst search is performed it is important to select
bursts according to their number of photons (burst size). In the most
rudimentary form this selection can be performed during burst search discarding
all the bursts
with size lower that a threshold $L$. This method, however, neglects the effect
of background and gamma factor on the burst size and can lead to a selection
bias of certain channels and/or sub-populations. 
For this reason we advocate performing a burst size selection after background
correction and taking into account the gamma factor, as illustrated in
section~\ref{sec:burstsel}.

\subsubsection{Burst search in FRETBursts}
\label{sec:burstsearch_code}

In FRETBursts the standard burst search is performed calling the
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data\_class.html#fretbursts.burstlib.Data.burst\_search}{\texttt{burst\_search} method}.

\begin{verbatim}
d.burst_search(F=6, m=10, ph_sel=Ph_sel('all'))
\end{verbatim}

The previous command performs a burst search on all photons
(\verb|ph_sel=Ph_sel('all')|), with a minimum rate 6 times larger than the
background rate (\verb|F=6|) and using 10 consecutive photons to compute the
local rate (\verb|m=10|).
A different photon selection, threshold ($F$) or number of photons for rate
computation $m$ can be selected by passing a different value. These parameters
are generally a good starting point for smFRET analysis but can be tweaked in
specific cases.

Note that, in the previous burst search, no burst size selection is performed
(i.e. the minimum bursts size is $m$). 
An additional parameter $L$ can be passed to apply a threshold on the raw burst
size (before any correction). 
We however suggest to perform a more accurate burst size selection as shown in
the next section~\ref{sec:burstsel}.

In us-ALEX there are 3 important correction parameters: gamma factor, spectral
leakage and 
acceptor direct excitation~\cite{Lee_2005}. These corrections can be applied by
simply setting the respective
Data attributes:

\begin{verbatim}
d.gamma = 0.85
d.leakage = 0.04
d.dir_ex = 0.08
\end{verbatim}

These attributes can be assigned either before or after the burst search. In the
latter case, the burst data is
automatically updated using the newly assigned correction values.

Sometimes it may be useful to specify a fixed threshold, instead 
of a threshold derived from the background rate like in the previous example. In
this case, instead of $F$ we can use the argument \verb|min_rate_cps| that
specifies a threshold in Hertz. For example, a burst search with a 50~kHz
threshold can be performed as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
d.burst_search(min_rate_cps=50e3, m=10, ph_sel=Ph_sel('all'))
\end{verbatim}

Finally, to perform a DCBS burst search (or in general an AND-gate burst search,

see section~\ref{sec:burstsearch_intro}) the plugin function 
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins.html#fretbursts.burstlib\_ext.burst\_search\_and\_gate}{\texttt{burst\_search\_and\_gate}}

can be used like in the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
d_dcbs = bext.burst_search_and_gate(d, F=6, m=10)
\end{verbatim}

Note that in this case a new \verb|Data| variable is returned (\verb|d_dcbp|)
containing all the data and the results of the new burst search. In order to
save RAM, FRETBursts shares the timestamps and detectors arrays between
different copies of a \verb|Data| object (for example \verb|d| and
\verb|d_dcbs|), while all the other data (including background and burst data)
is copied. 

The function \verb|burst_search_and_gate| accepts additional arguments
\verb|ph_sel1| and \verb|ph_sel2| 
used to specify different photons streams. The default values 
(\verb|ph_sel1 = Ph_sel(Dex='DAem')| and \verb|ph_sel2 = Ph_sel(Aex='Aem')|)
correspond to the classical DCBS 
(see section~\ref{sec:burstsearch_intro}).
