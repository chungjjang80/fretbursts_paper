\subsection{Coding style}

FRETBursts has an well commented codebase with more that 35\% of source code
being commments (for comparison the average project on OpenHub has 25\%
of commments). To ease readability most of the PEP8 code style rules are followed.
and docstrings use the highly-readable napoleon format.

The reference documentation is built from the source files with Sphinx and
all the API documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings.
On each commit the documentation is automatically built by ReadTheDocs.org
and available online after a few minutes.

Unit tests cover most of the core algorithms ensuring consistency and 
minimizing the probability of introducing bugs. The continous integration
service TravisCI is used to execute the full test suite after each commit.
As a rule, whenever a bug is discovered the bug is fixed and a new test is 
written to ensure that the same bug cannot happen in the future.
