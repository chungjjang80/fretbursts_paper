\section{Conclusions}

We have described the usage of the numerous algorithms in FRETBursts
for burst analysis. We conclude enumerating what we consider to be the strengths
of this software.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Opensource and openly developed. The source code can be checked, modified and
adapted for different purposes. All the software dependencies are open source as well.
\item Provides several state-of-the-art and novel algorithms for each step of the 
smFRET burst analysis pipeline. Just to cite a few, to the best of our knowledge, no other available software
(open or closed source) implements background estimation as a function of time,
background-dependent threshold for burst search, burst filtering based on 
gamma-corrected burst sizes and burst weighting.
\item Modern software engineering design: we follows the DRY rule, we aim at not
overenginering balancing between object oriented and procedural approach
\item Defensive programming: we aim for the maximum code redability,
estensive unit and regression testing and continuous integration.
\end{enumerate}

Given these features FRETBursts is suitable both as a toolkit to develop novel algorithms
in smFRET burst analysis or as a software for processing smFRET data files with
state-of-the art algorithms.
