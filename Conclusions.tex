\section{Conclusions}

We have described the usage of the numerous algorithms in FRETBursts
for burst analysis. We conclude enumerating what we consider to be the strengths
of this software.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Opensource and openly developed. The source code can be checked, modified and
adapted for different purposes. 
\item Provides several state-of-the-art and novel algorithms for each step of the 
smFRET burst analysis pipeline. Just to cite a few we are not aware of any other software
(open or close source) that implements background estimation as a function of time,
background-dependent threshold for burst search, burst filtering based on 
gamma-corrected burst sizes and burst weighting.
\item Modern software engineering design: we follows the DRY rule, we aim at not
overenginering balancing between object oriented and procedural approach
\item Defensive programming: we aim for the maximum code redability,
estensive unit and regression testing and continuous integration.
\end{enumerate}

Finally we ancourage feedbacks, bug reports and contributions.
