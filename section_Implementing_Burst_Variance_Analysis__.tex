\section{Implementing Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) with FRETBursts}


Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) is the analysis method for single molecule FRET experiments, which has developed to detect molecular dynamics~\cite{Torella_2011}. It has been successfully implemented to identify heterogeneities in FRET histograms attributed to dynamic processes in millisecond time scale~\cite{Torella_2011, Robb_2013}.
