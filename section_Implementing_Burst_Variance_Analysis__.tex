\section{Implementing Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) with FRETBursts}

FRET histograms could show more information than just mean FRET efficiencies. Broad FRET distributions might be caused by the mixture of multiple species with static but different FRET efficiencies, single species with dynamic fluctuation between multiple FRET states, or a combination of the two. Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) is the analysis method for single molecule FRET experiments, which has developed to detect molecular dynamics~\cite{Torella_2011}. It has been successfully implemented to identify heterogeneities in FRET histograms attributed to dynamic processes in millisecond time scale~\cite{Torella_2011, Robb_2013}.
