\section{Implementing Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) with FRETBursts}

FRET histograms could show more information than just mean FRET efficiencies. Broad FRET distributions might be attributed to 1) the mixture of multiple species with static but different FRET efficiencies, 2) single species with dynamic fluctuations between multiple FRET states, or 3) a combination of the two cases. Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) is an analysis method for single molecule FRET experiments, developed to detect molecular dynamics~\cite{Torella_2011}. It has been successfully implemented to identify heterogeneities in FRET histograms due to dynamic processes in millisecond time scale~\cite{Torella_2011, Robb_2013}.
