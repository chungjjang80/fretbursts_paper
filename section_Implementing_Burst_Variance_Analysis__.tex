\section{Implementing Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) with FRETBursts}

FRET histograms have more information than just mean FRET efficiencies. Broad FRET distributions may indicate the presence of static heterogeneity, dynamic heterogeneity, or a combination of the two. Static heterogeneity is due to the coexistence of multiple species with static but distinct FRET efficiencies in the same sample, whereas dynamic heterogeneity is due to a single molecular species that fluctuates between multiple distinct FRET states. Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) is the analysis method for single molecule FRET experiments, which has developed to detect molecular dynamics~\cite{Torella_2011}. It has been successfully implemented to identify heterogeneities in FRET histograms attributed to dynamic processes in millisecond time scale~\cite{Torella_2011, Robb_2013}.
