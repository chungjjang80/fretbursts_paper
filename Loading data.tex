\subsection{Loading the data}
Currently, FRETBursts supports loading data from a few file formats: SM files (a binary format saved by a common LabVIEW program used in smFRET setups), SPC (a binary format used by TCSPC Becker \& Hickl cards) and \href{https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/wiki/HDF5-Ph-Data-format-0.2-Draft}{HDF5-Ph-Data}  an open binary format single-molecule data based on HDF5.

We encourage adopting the \href{https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/wiki/HDF5-Ph-Data-format-0.2-Draft}{HDF5-Ph-Data} format because it is relatively simple, scalable, well documented, space efficient and very fast (a more expanded explanation \href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/HDF5_format.html}{here}). All the FRETBursts example data files are in HDF5-Ph-Data. An additional file-set can be found here[multi-spot paper data files].

All the functions to load the different file formats are defined in the \href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/loader.html}{\texttt{loader} module}. In particular, to load an HDF5-Ph-Data file use:

\begin{verbatim}
d = loader.hdf5(file_name)
\end{verbatim}
