\subsection{Timestamps and burst data}
\label{sec:burststimes}

FRETBursts provides an infrastructure for exploring new analysis approaches.
Users can easily get timestamps (or masks) for any photon stream.
Moreover the low-level burst data (essentially start and stop times and indexes 
and derived quantities) are stored in Bursts objects. 
The advantages over a numpy array are:

- ease of use: fields are accessed by name (e.g. start, stop, counts, etc...)
- performances: element access and iteration is faster than numpy arrays or Pandas Dataframes
- pretty printing in the notebook (displayed as HTML table)
- added functionality: methods to transform burst data to be relative to different timestamp array

Bursts implements all the common operations performed with burst data and is heavily 
tested by the unit test framework. Leveraging Bursts methods, users can implement new 
types of analysis without wasting time implementing (and debugging) routine manipulations.
