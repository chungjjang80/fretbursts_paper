\section{Coding style, testing and bug disclosure}

FRETBursts has an well commented codebase with more that 35\% of source code
being commments (for comparison the average project registered on OpenHub has 25\%
of commments). To ease readability we follow most of the PEP8 code style rules and the highly-readable napoleon format for the docstrings.

The reference documentation is built from the source files with Sphinx and
all the API documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings.
On each commit the documentation is automatically built by 
\href{https://readthedocs.org/}{ReadTheDocs}
and available online after a few minutes.

Unit tests cover most of the core algorithms ensuring consistency and 
minimizing the probability of introducing bugs. The continous integration
service \href{http://travis-ci.org}{Travis CI} is used to execute the full
test suite after each commit.
As a rule, whenever a bug is discovered the bug is fixed and a new test is 
written to ensure that the same bug cannot happen in the future.

In addition of the unit tests, a specialized regression-test notebook
that compares results between two versions of FRETBursts is
included in the source tree and periodically executed. Additionally
the tutorials itselfs are periodically executed to ensure that
no errors or regressions are introduced.

Finally, the full set of notebooks for the multi-spot paper analysis,
including notebooks for extensive Âµs-ALEX analysis are periodically
executed and a dedicated notebooks ensures that all the numerical
results remain unchanged within the numerical accuracy.

Code readbility, rigouros development practice and extensive testing
shows that all the efforts have been made to minimize the presence 
of bugs.

We commit at publically disclosing any bug that may result in erroneus results 
as soon as the bug is discovered or comunicated to us.
Each bug will be openly discussed on a GitHub issue and a fix will be released 
in a timely fashion.
