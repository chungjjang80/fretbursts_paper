\section{Development style and contributions}

Bugs are an inevitable reality in any reasonably complex software. It is 
therefore critical to implement countermeasures measures which
minimize the probability of introducing bugs and their potential impact~\cite{Prli__2012}.
We strive to follow moder best-practices in software development which are summarized 
below.

In FRETBursts, we highly value source code readability, a property which can 
reduce the number of bugs by facilitating understanding and verifying the code.
For this puporpose, FRETBursts code-base is well commented (more that 35\%
of source code), 
follows the  \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP8 python code style rules}.
and has docstrings in \href{http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/}{napoleon format}.

Reference documentation is built with \href{http://sphinx-doc.org/}{Sphinx} and
all the API documents are automatically generated from docstrings.
On each commit, documentation is automatically built and deployed on
\href{https://readthedocs.org/}{ReadTheDocs.org}.

Unit tests cover most of the core algorithms, ensuring consistency and
minimizing the probability of introducing bugs. 
The \href{http://travis-ci.org}{Travis CI} continuous integration service, 
executes the full test suite on each commit, timely reporting errors.
As a rule, whenever a bug is discovered, the  fix also includes a new test
to ensure that the same bug cannot happen in the future.

In addition to the unit tests, we include a
\href{https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/blob/master/notebooks/dev/tests/FRETBursts\%20-\%20Regression\%20tests.ipynb}{regression-test notebook}
to easily compares numerical results between two versions of FRETBursts. 
Additionally, the tutorials themselves are executed before each release as
an additional test layer to ensure that no errors or regressions are introduced.

Finally, the full set of notebooks used in the multi-spot paper analysis,
including notebooks for extensive Âµs-ALEX analysis are periodically
re-executed and results compared across executions to ensure that
they agree within the floating point tolerances.

Code readability, best-practice development style and extensive testing
contribute to minimizing the presence of bugs in FRETBursts.
