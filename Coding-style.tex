\section{Development style and contributions}

FRETBursts code-base is extensively commented with more that 35\%
of the source code consisting of comments (for comparison the average project
registered on OpenHub has 25\% of comments).
In developping FRETBursts, we highly value the source code readability,
therefore we follow the
\href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP8 python code style rules} and
the \href{http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/}{napoleon format}
for the docstrings.

The reference documentation is built from the source files with \href{http://sphinx-doc.org/}{Sphinx} with
all the API documentation automatically generated from the docstrings.
On each commit, the documentation is automatically built by
\href{https://readthedocs.org/}{Read the Docs}
and available online after a few minutes.

Unit tests cover most of the core algorithms, ensuring consistency and
minimizing the probability of introducing bugs. The continuous integration
service, \href{http://travis-ci.org}{Travis CI}, is used to execute the full
test suite after each commit.
As a rule, whenever a bug is discovered, the  fix also includes a new test
to ensure that the same bug cannot happen in the future.

In addition to the unit tests, a specialized
\href{https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/blob/master/notebooks/dev/tests/FRETBursts\%20-\%20Regression\%20tests.ipynb}{regression-test notebook}
which compares results between two versions of FRETBursts is
included in the source tree and periodically executed. Additionally
the tutorials themselves are periodically executed to ensure that
no errors or regressions are introduced.

Finally, the full set of notebooks used in the multi-spot paper analysis,
including notebooks for extensive Âµs-ALEX analysis are periodically
re-executed and results compared across executions to ensure that
they agree within the floating point tolerances.

Code readability, rigorous development practice and extensive testing
are all efforts undertaken to minimize the presence of bugs.

Bugs that may result in erroneous results will be publicly disclosed as soon as
they are discovered or communicated to us.
