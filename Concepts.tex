\section{Architecture and concepts}
\label{sec:concepts}

In this section we introduce some general concepts and naming conventions related 
to the smFRET burst analysis in FRETBursts.

\subsection{Photon streams}
\label{sec:ph_streams}

The fundamental data at the core of smFRET experiments is the array of photon
arrival timestamps, with a temporal resolution usually of the order of 10~ns. In single-spot
measurements, all the timestamps are stored in a single array. In multi-spot
measurements~\cite{Ingargiola_2013} we have as many timestamps arrays as the number of excitation
spots.

Each array contains timestamps from both the donor (D) and the
acceptor (A) channels. In ALEX measurements~\cite{Lee_2005}, we can further 
differentiate between
photons emitted during D and A excitation periods. In FRETBursts the different
selections of photons/timestamps are called "photon streams" and they are
specified with a
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ph_sel.html}{\texttt{Ph\_sel}
object} . In non-ALEX smFRET data we have 3 base photon streams
(table~\ref{tab:ph_sel_smfret}), while in ALEX data we have 5 base photon
streams (table~\ref{tab:ph_sel_alex}).

The
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ph_sel.html}{\texttt{Ph\_sel}
class} allows the expression of any combination of photon streams. 
For example, in ALEX measurements, the D-emission during A-excitation stream is
usually excluded because it does not contain any useful signal~\cite{Lee_2005}.
To indicate all but the photons in this photon stream we write
\verb|Ph_sel(Dex='DAem', Aex='Aem')|, which literally means \textit{select donor
and acceptor photons (DAem) during donor excitation (Dex) and only acceptor
photons (Aem) during acceptor excitation (Aex)}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Photon selection  & code \\
  \hline
  All-photons       & \verb|Ph_sel('all')|\\
  D-emission    & \verb|Ph_sel(Dex='Dem')|\\
  A-emission & \verb|Ph_sel(Dex='Aem')|\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:ph_sel_smfret}Photon selection syntax (non-ALEX)}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}

  \hline

  A-emission during A-excitation & \verb|Ph_sel(Aex='Aem')|\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:ph_sel_alex}Photon selection syntax (ALEX)}
\end{table}

\subsection{Background definitions}
\label{sec:bg_intro}

The recorded stream of timestamps is comprised of two processes: one with 
high rate, due to fluorescence photons of single molecules crossing the 
excitation volume, and another with lower rate due to “background
counts” originating from the detectors dark counts, out of focus molecules
and sample scattering and/or auto-fluorescence\cite{Gopich_2008}. 
These two processes can be 
observed in the distribution of timestamps' delays (i.e. the waiting times 
between two subsequent timestamps) as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bgdist}.
The “tail” of the distribution (a line in semi-log scale) corresponds 
to exponentially-distributed delays, indicating that those counts are generated by a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process}{Poisson process}. At short
timescales, the distribution departs from the exponential trend due to overlap with the higher rate process of single molecules traversing the excitation volume. To estimate the background
rate, (i.e. the exponential time constant) we need to select a minimal
timestamp delay threshold, above which the distribution can be considered exponential. We also need to choose a fitting method, for example the Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or a curve fit of the histogram via non-linear
least squares (NLSQ).

An estimation of the background rates is needed both to select a proper threshold for
burst search and to correct the raw burst counts by subtracting the background counts.
Furthermore, it is advisable to periodically estimate the background
in order to track occasional variations during the measurement. Experimentally
we found that when the background is not constant, it varies on time scales of tens of seconds 
(see figure~\ref{fig:bg_timetrace}). FRETBursts splits the data in uniform time
slices called \textit{background periods} and computes the background rates for
each of these slices (see section~\ref{sec:bg_calc}). Note that the slicing 
in background
periods is also used during burst search to compute a background-dependent
threshold and to apply the burst correction (section~\ref{sec:burstsearch}).

\subsection{The \texttt{Data} class}
\label{sec:data_intro}

The
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_class.html}{\texttt{Data}
class} is the fundamental data container in FRETBursts. It contains the
measurement data and provides several methods for data analysis (background
estimation, burst search, etc...). It also stores all the analysis results
(bursts data, estimated parameters).

All the arrays in \texttt{Data} are contained in lists with lengths equal to the
number of excitation spots. This means that for single-spot measurements all the
arrays are wrapped in 1-element lists. For example, the bursts data field
\verb|Data.mbursts| will be a 1-element list and \verb|Data.mbursts[0]| will be
the actual numpy array of burst data. \verb|Data| implements a shortcut syntax
that allows accessing 
\verb|Data.mbursts[0]| as \verb|Data.mbursts_| (valid for all the fields).

As an example the following are some important burst-data fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|nd|: number of photons detected through the donor channel during
donor excitation, after correction
\item \verb|na|: number of photons detected through the acceptor channel during
donor excitation, after correction
\item \verb|naa|: number of photons detected through the acceptor channel during
acceptor excitation, after correction
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Introduction to burst search}
\label{sec:burstsearch_intro}

Identifying the single-molecule bursts in the stream of photon timestamps is 
one of the most crucial steps in the analysis of freely-diffusing single-molecule measurement data.
The widely-used "sliding window" algorithm, proposed by
Eggeling~\textit{et al.} in 1998~\cite{Eggeling_1998}, involves searching for
bursts of photons
in which $m$ consecutive photons are contained within a minimal time period
$\Delta t$. In other words, bursts are portions of the photon stream where the
local rate (computed using $m$ photons) is above a minimal rate chosen as a
threshold. Eggeling did not provide any criteria on how to choose the rate
threshold and the number of photons $m$ and as therefore it has become a common
practice to manually tweak those parameters for each specific measurement. 

A more general approach consists in taking into account the background rate of
the specific measurements and in choosing a rate threshold that is $F$ times
larger than the background rate. This approach assures that all the resulting bursts
have a Signal-To-Background ratio (SBR) larger than
$(F-1)$~\cite{Michalet_2012}. A consistent criterion for choosing the threshold is
very important when comparing different measurements with different background
rates, when the background significantly varies during measurements or in
multi-spot measurements where each spot has a different background rate.

A second important aspect of burst search is which photon stream is processed.
In some cases, for instance when identifying FRET populations, one would like to
apply the burst search to all the photons. Other times, when focusing on
donor-only or acceptor only populations, it is better to use only the donor or
acceptor signal. In general one would like to be able to apply the burst search
to an arbitrary selection of photons. In FRETBursts this can be achieved by passing
the appropriate \verb|Ph_sel| object to the burst search method (see
section~\ref{sec:ph_streams} for more info on photon stream definitions).

Finally, Nir~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Nir_2006} proposed a Dual-Channel Burst
Search (DCBS) that can help mitigating artifacts due to
photo-physical effects such as photo-blinking. In this case a search is performed
independently on two photon streams and bursts are marked only when both photon
streams exhibit a rate higher than the threshold, 
implementing a kind of AND-gate logic. 
Usually, the term DCBS refers to a burst search where the two photon streams
are (1) all the photons 
during donor excitation (\verb|Ph_sel(Dex='DAem')|) and (2) acceptor channel photons
during acceptor 
excitation (\verb|Ph_sel(Aex='Aem')|).

After each burst search it is important to select
bursts according to their number of photons (burst size). In the most
basic form, this selection can be performed during burst search by discarding
bursts with size smaller than a threshold $L$, as originally proposed by 
Eggeling~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Eggeling_1998}. 
This method, however, neglects the effect
of background and gamma factor on the burst size and can lead to a selection
bias of certain channels and/or sub-populations. 
For this reason we advocate performing a burst size selection after background
correction and taking into account the gamma factor, as illustrated in
section~\ref{sec:burstsel}.


\subsection{Burst weights}

As will be shown in the following sections, the burst search returns bursts of different sizes (i.e. number of photons). 
Bursts with large size (that indeed contain most of the information) 
are much less frequent than bursts with smaller sizes. For this reason, in order 
to resolve FRET populations and accurately assess their mean FRET efficiency, it is of
paramount importance to select bursts with size larger than a given threshold (see 
section~\ref{sec:burstsel}). The choice of burst size threshold is 
critical because a too low threshold will widen FRET subpopulations owing to the 
inclusion of small sized bursts having higher FRET uncertainty. Conversely 
a too high threshold will result in a lower number of bursts and FRET estimation 
can suffer from high statistical error.

In order to mitigate the dependence on the burst size threshold it may be 
useful to weight bursts according to their size (i.e. their 
information content) so that the biggest bursts will have the highest weights. 
The weighting can be used to build weighted histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots.
When using weights the choice of a particular burst size threshold becomes 
much less important and the histograms or KDE plots exhibit minimal-width
peaks corresponding to different FRET populations for a much wider range
of thresholds. 

FRETBursts allows weighting bursts using the gamma-corrected burst size
(\verb|gamma*nd + na|) and optionally adding the acceptor counts during
acceptor excitation (\verb|naa|). Once the size is defined, the weights
can be computed according to different criteria among which the most
commonly used is \verb|'size'|, meaning to associate a weight 
directly proportional to the burst size. The list of weight types
can be found in the 
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fret_fit.html#fretbursts.fret_fit.get_weights}{\texttt{fret\_fit.get\_weights} documentation}.

\subsection{Plotting "Data"}

FRETBursts uses matplotlib~\cite{2096e2a4-8f50-4519-bfb3-f796da201630} to
provide a wide range of 
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plots.html}{built-in plot functions}
for \verb|Data| objects. 
The plot syntax is the same both for single and multi-spot measurements. 
The majority of plot commands are called through the wrapper function 
\verb|dplot|, for example to plot a timetrace of the photon data we type:

\begin{verbatim}
dplot(d, timetrace)
\end{verbatim}

The function \verb|dplot| is the generic plot function that creates the figure
and handles details common to all the plotting functions (i.e. the title).
\verb|d| is the \verb|Data| variable and \verb|timetrace| is the actual plot
function that operates on a single channel. In multi-spot measurements
\verb|dplot| creates one subplot for each spot and calls \verb|timetrace| for
each channel.

All the built-in plot functions that can be passed to 
\verb|dplot| are defined in the 
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plots.html}{\texttt{burst\_plot} module}. 
When importing FRETbursts all the plot functions are also imported. 
To facilitate finding the plot functions through auto-completion, 
their names start with a standard prefix indicating the
plot type. The prefixes are: \verb|timetrace| for binned timetraces
of photon data, \verb|ratetrace| for rates of photons as a function of time (non
binnned), \verb|hist| for functions plotting histograms and \verb|scatter| for
scatter plots.

Additional plots can be easily created directly with matplotlib.

Usually plots are displayed inline in the notebook. However a few plot functions
 such as \verb|timetrace| and \verb|hist2d_alex| have interactive features that
can be enabled when using the QT4 backend that opens the plot in an external
window. It is possible to switch backend from inline to QT and vice versa using
the ipython commands \verb|%matplotlib qt|
and \verb|%matplotlib inline|. For example, after switching to the QT4 backend
the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
dplot(d, timetrace, scroll=True)
\end{verbatim}

opens a new window with a timetrace plot and an horizontal scroll-bar for quick
"scrolling" throughout the measurement.
Similarly, calling the \verb|hist2d_alex| function with the QT4 backend allows
selecting an area on the E-S histogram using the mouse.

\begin{verbatim}
dplot(ds, hist2d_alex, gui_sel=True)
\end{verbatim}

The values that identify the region are printed and can be copied an pasted as
argument for the burst selection function \verb|select_bursts.ES| (see
section~\ref{sec:burstsel}).
