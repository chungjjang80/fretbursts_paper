  abstract = {Here we provide high resolution study of DNA hairpin dynamics achieved by probability distribution analysis (PDA) of diffusion-based single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (sm-FRET) histograms. The opening and closing rates of three hairpins both free and attached to DNA origami were determined. The agreement with rates previously obtained using the total internal reflection (TIRF) technique and between free hairpins and hairpins attached to origami validated the PDA and demonstrated that the origami had no influence on the hairpin dynamics. From comparison of rates of four DNA hairpins, differing only in stem sequence, and from comparison with rates calculated using nearest-neighbor method and standard transition state theory, we conclude that the unfolding reaction resembles that of melting of DNA duplex with a corresponding sequence and that the folding reaction depends on counterion concentration and not on stem sequence. Our validation and demonstration of the PDA method will encourage its implementation in future high-resolution dynamic studies of freely diffusing biomolecules.},

@article{Antonik2006,
  abstract = {We establish a probability distribution analysis (PDA) method for the analysis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals to determine with high precision the originating value of a shot-noise-limited signal distribution. PDA theoretical distributions are calculated explicitly including crosstalk, stochastic variations, and background and represent the minimum width that a FRET distribution must have. In this way an unambiguous distinction is made between shot-noise distributions and distributions broadened by heterogeneities. This method simultaneously and effectively extracts highly resolved information from FRET distributions. The theoretical histograms match the exact profile of histograms generated from constant transfer efficiency experimental data with a chi2 near unity. The chi2 surface suggests an ultimate level of precision with FRET of < 1\% of the F\"{o}rster radius. Distributions of FRET signals in donor-acceptor-labeled DNA were unambiguously identified as being broader than shot-noise variations could explain. A model describing a Gaussian distribution of distances was tested with the PDA method and demonstrated 5 A inhomogeneities due to dye motions. The capability of this method to recover quantitative information from FRET distributions has potential applications for studying molecular conformations and dynamics. Potential sources for artifacts such as acceptor photobleaching, spectrally different observation volumes, and fluctuations of the F\"{o}rster radius are ruled out.},

  abstract = {Single molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful experimental technique for studying the properties of individual biological molecules in solution. However, as adoption of smFRET techniques becomes more widespread, the lack of available software, whether open source or commercial, for data analysis, is becoming a significant issue. Here, we present pyFRET, an open source Python package for the analysis of data from single-molecule fluorescence experiments from freely diffusing biomolecules. The package provides methods for the complete analysis of a smFRET dataset, from burst selection and denoising, through data visualisation and model fitting. We provide support for both continuous excitation and alternating laser excitation (ALEX) data analysis. pyFRET is available as a package downloadable from the Python Package Index (PyPI) under the open source three-clause BSD licence, together with links to extensive documentation and tutorials, including example usage and test data. Additional documentation including tutorials is hosted independently on ReadTheDocs. The code is available from the free hosting site Bitbucket. Through distribution of this software, we hope to lower the barrier for the adoption of smFRET experiments by other research groups and we encourage others to contribute modules for specific analysis needs.},
