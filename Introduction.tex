\section{Introduction}

\subsection{smFRET and burst analysis}

FRETBursts is an open source python software for burst analysis of confocal 
single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) data. The software can analyze smFRET measurements
with one or several excitation spots~\cite{Ingargiola_2013}. The supported 
excitation schemes include single lasers, Alternating Laser EXcitation (ALEX) with either two CW lasers (µs-ALEX \cite{Kapanidis_2005}) 
or two interleaved pulsed lasers (ns-ALEX \cite{16287971} or Pulsed-Interleaved Excitation (PIE) \cite{M_ller_2005}). 
FRETBursts is hosted and and openly developed~\cite{Prli__2012} on GitHub, where
issues, feature requests and contributions can be reported.

In this paper we provide a broad overview of FRETBursts. 
The paper is structured as follows. 
In the next subsections mention how to install~(\ref{sec:install}) and 
load~(\ref{sec:import}) FRETBursts.
In section~\ref{sec:concepts} we
introduce a few preliminary concepts and some specific terminology.
In section~\ref{sec:analysis} we illustrate how to execute the several steps involved
in smFRET burst analysis: data loading (section~\ref{sec:dataload}), defining 
excitation alternation periods (section~\ref{sec:alternation}), background 
correction (section~\ref{sec:bg_calc}), burst search (section~\ref{sec:burstsearch}), 
burst filtering (section~\ref{sec:burstsel}) and FRET fitting (section~\ref{sec:fretfit}). 
For each step different approaches and options are discussed. 
In section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude by stating what we believe are
the strengths of this software.

In addition to this paper, we refer the interested readers to the

for a single complete example of µs-ALEX data analysis and to the
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/}{FRETBursts Reference Documentation}
for a detailed description of each function.

\subsection{Installing FRETBursts}
\label{sec:install}
FRETBursts is a python package that requires a standard set of scientific 
python libraries called the \href{http://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html}{"scipy stack"}.
Those libraries are included in all the major scientific python distributions such as 
\href{https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/}{Continuum Anaconda}.

FRETBursts can be installed through the standard python package manager (PIP)
or through \href{http://conda.pydata.org/docs/}{conda}.
Alternatively the latest development version can be downloaded directly 
from GitHub. For more information on different installation methods refer to the 
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html}{Getting Started}
section in the FRETBursts documentation.

\subsection{Executing FRETBursts}
\label{sec:import}
In general, we suggest to import FRETbursts with the expression:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import fretbursts as fb
\end{verbatim}

after which all the FRETBursts functions will be availabe under the \verb|fb.|
prefix. In this article, for brevity, we assume that FRETBursts is imported 
with the shortcut form instead:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from fretbursts import *
\end{verbatim}

that allows skipping the \verb|fb.| prefix and it will also import some common 
numeric libraries (i.e. \textit{numpy} and \textit{matplotlib.pyplot} 
imported as \verb|np| and \verb|plt| respectively).

In order to enable the reproducibility of the analysis and to ease
the sharing of the complete workflow we encourage using FRETBursts through 
the IPython Notebook environment. 
IPython notebooks are documents in which the code is interspersed with 
prose in a web-based format that can contain math formulas, hyperlinks 
and figures (or anything else a web browser can display).
Furthermore, the "notebook workflow"\cite{Shen_2014} has the advantage 
of automatically recording not only the all analysis commands and parameters 
but also the data file names, software versions and the full output 
(figures, tables, etc...) in a single document that can be interactively 
modified and re-executed.

All the FRETBursts tutorials are 
ipython notebooks and, in fact, the preferred way to start a new analysis is by 
copying and modifying a pre-existing FRETBursts notebook.
