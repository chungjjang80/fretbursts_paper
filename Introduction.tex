\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is FRETBursts}

In the last 20 years the field of single molecule spectroscopy has seen a remarkable
growth from a pioneristic technology to a widespread analysis performed by many labs
across the world. Among the techniques that probe freely-diffusing molecules,
single-molecule FRET (smFRET) is one of the most successful, able to provide
information on conformational changes or monitor binding-unbinding kinetics on
a single-molecule level.

The field of freely-diffusing smFRET data analysis has seen a number of significant 
contributions over the years but still there is no clear consensus on a single
universal approach for data analysis.
Even though a wide variety of algorithms have been proposed over the years, very few 
of have been widely embraced by the community at large. One of the main issues 
is that the analysis of smFRET data is complex and requires a significant 
development effort. Currently,
each research group have reimplemented its own unpublished or closed-source versions
of the analysis software, with very little collaboration or code sharing. 
The fact that the implementation of a freely-diffusing smFRET setup can significantly 
vary (in number of polarization or spectral channels for example), 
makes the problem only worst.
This situation, represents a huge duplication of efforts and a real 
impediment to the scientific progress. 
In fact, the differences in implementation details among the various software
are enough that a direct comparison of their results is very difficult. 
This limits the ability to validate the correctness
of one software but also to compare the performance of different algorithms
in estimating physical quantities.

In order to start addressing these issues we developed FRETBursts, 
an open source python software for burst analysis of freely-diffusing
single-molecule smFRET experiments. 
With FRETRBursts we aim to provide a tool that is available to any scientist
to use, study and modify. 
FRETBursts is hosted and openly developed~\cite{Prli__2012} on GitHub, 
and we encourage users to send comments, issues, contributions through
the GitHub website.

\subsection{Paper overview}

Understanding the smFRET burst analysis requires several concepts and definitions.
In this paper we aim to provide a brief introduction to smFRET analysis concepts
and terminology used by FRETBursts. We illustrate how to perform
the fundamental steps of burst analysis, highlighting key parameters
and algorithms available. We will not cover extensively all the FRETBursts
features and options. For more detailed information, the interested readers can refer
to the FRETBursts Reference Documentation and to the source code (that we strive
to make readable and well commented).
Furthermore, users can ask question about FRETBursts use by opening 
a new issue on GitHub.

The paper is structured as follows.
In the next section~\ref{sec:overview} we give an overview of the software features,
the modality of execution and the development style.
In section~\ref{sec:concepts}, we
introduce a few preliminary concepts and some specific terminology needed
to understand the smFRET burst analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we detail the execution the several steps involved
in smFRET burst analysis: data loading (section~\ref{sec:dataload}), defining
excitation alternation periods (section~\ref{sec:alternation}), background
correction (section~\ref{sec:bg_calc}), burst search (section~\ref{sec:burstsearch}),
burst selection (section~\ref{sec:burstsel}) and FRET fitting (section~\ref{sec:fretfit}).
The aim is to provide enough information to understand the specificities of
the different algorithms and to be able to adapt the analysis to new situations.
Finally, in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}, we summarize what we believe to be
the strengths of FRETBursts software.

In addition to this paper, we refer the interested readers to the
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/FRETBursts\%20-\%20us-ALEX\%20smFRET\%20burst\%20analysis.ipynb}{FRETBursts µs-ALEX tutorial}
for a single complete example of µs-ALEX data analysis and to the
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/}{FRETBursts Reference Documentation}
for a more in-depth description of the software. The reference documentation
includes also a special section describing how to install and run the software
for users without any prior python knowledge.

Finally, in order to make this paper accessible to the widest number of readers,
we concentrated python-specific details in special subsections titled
\textit{Python details}. These subsections provide deeper insights for readers
already familiar with python and can be safely skipped otherwise. Note also
that all commands shown in this paper can be found in the FRETBursts tutorial notebook
and, in general, do not need to be re-typed.
