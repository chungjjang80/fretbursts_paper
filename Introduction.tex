\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is FRETBursts}

In the last 20 years, single molecule FRET (smFRET), has emerged as one of the most
useful techniques in single-molecule spectroscopy~\cite{Weiss_1999,Hohlbein_2014}. 
As opposed to ensemble experiments, smFRET allows to resolve conformational 
changes of biomolecules or measure binding-unbinding kinetics on heterogeneous samples. 
smFRET measurements on freely diffusing molecules (the focus of this paper) have the advantage 
of probing molecules and processes without perturbation from surface immobilization~\cite{Dahan_1999,Eggeling_1998}. 

The field of freely-diffusing smFRET data analysis, has seen a number of significant 
contributions over the 
years~\cite{Fries_1998,Eggeling_2001,Zhang_2005,Gopich_2005,Lee_2005,Nir_2006,Antonik2006,Gopich_2007,Gopich_2008,Camley_2009,Santoso_2010,Torella_2011,Tomov_2012}. 
However, so far, except for some fundamental steps of burst analysis, 
there is no single approach that is universally accepted and broadly applied. 
On one hand this situation stems from the fact that
different approaches tend to answer slightly different questions.
On the other hand, this is the result of the trade off in each research lab
between accuracy and software complexity, in particular on the amount of effort
each group wants to invest in implementing new non-trivial methods reported in literature.

In fact, except for a recent laudable example~\cite{Murphy2014}, 
each research group have reimplemented its own unpublished or closed-source versions
of the analysis software, with very little collaboration or code sharing.
Even in our group, past smFRET papers merely mention the usage of custom-made software without 
additional details~\cite{Lee_2005,Nir_2006}.
The fact that setups for freely-diffusing smFRET can significantly 
vary (in number of polarization or spectral channels for example), 
makes the problem only worst.
This situation, represents a real impediment to the scientific progress because:

(a) as new methods are proposed in literature, understandably, only few 
groups are willing (or have the resources) to invest the time necessary to reimplement them in their own
software, especially when contributions are incremental. 
In the rare occasions of new methods being groundbreaking, the reimplementation 
requires a systematic duplication of efforts. 

(b) both the non-availability of the software and the differences in implementation 
details render a direct comparison of different software implementations difficult, 
if not impossible. 
This limits the ability to cross-validate the correctness of different 
implementations of the same method or to compare accuracy and effectiveness
of different methods.

From a more general stance, since the pioneering work of Donoho group in the 90'~\cite{Buckheit_1995}, 
it is widely understood that developing and maintaining open source scientific software
for reproducible research is a critical requirement for progress in modern 
science~\cite{Ince_2012,Vihinen_2015}. Peer-reviewed publications describing such software are therefore necessary~\cite{Pradal_2013}, 
although the debate is still open on the most effective model for peer-reviewing this
class of publications~\cite{Check_Hayden_2013,Check_Hayden_2015} 
(\href{https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/04/quality-is-free-getting-there-isnt.html}{Willson 2015})
(\href{http://https://www.mozillascience.org/effective-code-review-for-journals}{Mills 2015})
(\href{http://http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-we-live-in-a-bubble.html}{Brown 2015} and \href{http://http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/on-code-review-of-scientific-code.html}{2013}).

Facing the previous issues, we decided to develop FRETBursts, 
an open source python software for burst analysis of freely-diffusing
single-molecule smFRET experiments. 
With FRETBursts we provide a tool that is available to any scientist
to use, study and modify. Furthermore, FRETBursts execution model 
is designed to facilitate computational reproducibility.
FRETBursts is hosted and openly developed on GitHub~\cite{Blischak_2016,Prli__2012}, 
where users can send comments, report issues or contribute code.

Understanding smFRET burst analysis requires several concepts and definitions.
In this paper we aim to provide a brief introduction to smFRET analysis concepts
and terminology used by FRETBursts. We illustrate how to perform
the fundamental steps of burst analysis, highlighting key parameters
and algorithms available. The aim is not covering all FRETBursts
features and options but providing an overview detailed enough for starting
using FRETbursts and customizing the analysis. For additional information, 
we refer the reader to the 
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/}{FRETBursts Reference Documentation}
. Finally, usage questions can be asked on the mailing list or on GitHub 
by opening an Issue.

\subsection{Paper overview}

The paper is structured as follows.
In the next section~\ref{sec:overview} we give an overview of the software features,
the modality of execution and the development style.
In section~\ref{sec:concepts}, we
introduce a few preliminary concepts and some specific terminology needed
to understand the smFRET burst analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we detail the execution the several steps involved
in smFRET burst analysis: data loading (section~\ref{sec:dataload}), defining
excitation alternation periods (section~\ref{sec:alternation}), background
correction (section~\ref{sec:bg_calc}), burst search (section~\ref{sec:burstsearch}),
burst selection (section~\ref{sec:burstsel}) and FRET fitting (section~\ref{sec:fretfit}).
The aim is to provide enough information to understand the specificities of
the different algorithms and to be able to adapt the analysis to new situations.
Finally, in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}, we summarize what we believe to be
the strengths of FRETBursts software.

In addition to this paper, we refer the interested readers to the
\href{http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/FRETBursts\%20-\%20us-ALEX\%20smFRET\%20burst\%20analysis.ipynb}{FRETBursts µs-ALEX tutorial}
for a single complete example of µs-ALEX data analysis and to the
\href{http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/}{FRETBursts Reference Documentation}
for a more in-depth description of the software. Throughout this paper,
we provide direct links to relevant sections of the FRETBursts documentation
and display them as ``(link)''.

Finally, in order to make this paper accessible to the widest number of readers,
we concentrated python-specific details in special subsections titled
\textit{Python details}. These subsections provide deeper insights for readers
already familiar with python and can be safely skipped otherwise. Note also
that all commands shown in this paper can be found in the FRETBursts tutorial notebook
and, in general, do not need to be re-typed.
