\section{smFRET data analysis}

In the following we provide a high-level description of FRETbursts usage. In general, we suggest to import FRETbursts with the expression:

\verb|import fretbursts as fb|

that will make available all the FRETBursts functions with a concise `fb.` prefix. In this article, however, we assume that FRETBursts is imported with the shortcut form:

\verb|from fretbursts import *|

that allows to skip the \verb|fb.| prefix and also imports some common numeric libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot imported as \verb|np|, \verb|pd| and \verb|plt| respectively).
