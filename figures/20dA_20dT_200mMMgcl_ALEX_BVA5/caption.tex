\label{fig:bva_static} Left figure is an E-S histogram for a mixture of single stranded DNA (20dT) and double stranded DNA (20dT-20dA) in the presence of 200mM MgCl$_2$, and Right figure is its BVA. Since both 20dT and 20dT-20dA are stable and no millisecond dynamics, BVA shows that $s_E$ sit on the expected standard deviation curve.
