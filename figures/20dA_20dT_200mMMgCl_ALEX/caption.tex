Left figure is ALEX histogram for the mixture of single stranded DNA(20dT) and double stranded DNA (20dT hybrized with its complementary strand, 20dA) in the presence of 200mM MgCl2, and Right figure is its BVA. Since two species are stable, without interconversion, BVA shows that $s_E$ only sit on the expected standard deviation curve.
