\label{fig:altern_hist_double}
Histograms used for excitation alternation periods selection for two typical smFRET experiments. 
Distributions of photons detected by the donor channels are in *green*, and by the acceptor channel in *red*.
The light *green* and *red* horizontal span mark the donor and acceptor period definitions.
(a) Âµs-ALEX alternation histogram, i.e. histogram of timestamps *modulo* the alternation period for a smFRET sample. 
(b) ns-ALEX nanotime histogram for a smFRET sample.
