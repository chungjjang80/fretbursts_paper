\label{fig:altern_hist_double} Histograms used for excitation alternation periods selection for two typical smFRET experiments. 
Distributions of photons detected by the donor channels are in \textit{green}, and by the acceptor channel in \textit{red}.
The light \textit{green} and \textit{red} horizontal span mark the donor and acceptor period definitions.
(a) Âµs-ALEX alternation histogram, i.e. histogram of timestamps \textit{modulo} the alternation period for a smFRET sample. 
(b) ns-ALEX nanotime histogram for a smFRET sample. Both plots have been generated by the same plot function (\texttt{plot\_alternation\_hist()}). 
Additional information on these specific measurements can be found in the  attached notebook.
