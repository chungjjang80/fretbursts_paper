Left figure is ALEX histogram for single stranded DNA (HP3, citation), which can form a hairpin structure temporarily in the presence of 400mM NaCl, and Right figure is its BVA. Since the interconversion between non-hairpin and hairpin structure causes a significant change in FRET efficiency, BVA shows that \$s_E\ on bridge between two populations sit largely above the expected standard deviation curve.
