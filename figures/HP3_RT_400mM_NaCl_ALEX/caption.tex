(b) Left figure is an E-S histogram for single stranded DNA ($A_{31}-TA$, see in~\cite{Tsukanov_2013}), which is designed to form a hairpin structure temporarily and reversibly in the presence of 400mM NaCl, and Right figure is its BVA. Since the transition between hairpin and open structure causes a significant change in FRET efficiency, BVA shows that $s_E$, in the bridge region between two populations, sit largely above the expected standard deviation curve.
