Left figure is an E-S histogram for single stranded DNA ($A_31$ $-TA$, see in ~\cite{Tsukanov_2013}), which is designed to form a hairpin structure temporarily and reversibly in the presence of 400mM NaCl, and Right figure is its BVA. Since the interconversion between non-hairpin and hairpin structure causes a significant change in FRET efficiency, BVA shows that $s_E$, in the bridge region between two populations, sit largely above the expected standard deviation curve.
