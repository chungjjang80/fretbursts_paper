\label{fig:alex_jointplot} A 2-D ALEX histogram and marginal E and S histograms obtained with \texttt{alex\_jointplot(ds)}. Bursts selected with a burst size threshold of 30 photons, including photons during the acceptor excitation. Three populations are visible: FRET population (middle), D-only population (top left) and A-only population (bottom, $S < 0.2$). Compare with figure~\ref{fig:alex_jointplot_fretsel} where the 
FRET population has been isolated.
