\label{fig:bg_dist_multi} A typical delay distribution and exponential fit for different photon streams as obtained with \texttt{dplot(d, hist\_bg)}. The \textit{dots} represent the experimental histogram for the different photon streams. The \textit{solid lines} represent the corresponding exponetial fit of the tail of the distributions. The legend shows the photon streams
represented by each color and the fitted rate.
