\label{fig:altern_hist}
Histograms of timestamps modulate the alternation periods. The green histogram represents
donor photons while the red histogram represents acceptor photons. The light green and
light red hightlights mark the definition of excitiation periods (respectively
for donor and acceptor channel).
