\label{fig:bg_timetrace} Estimated background rate as a function of time for two Âµs-ALEX measurements. Different colors represent different photon streams. Plot (a), a measurement performed with a sealed sample chamber exhibiting constant the background as a function of time. Plots (b), a measurement performed on an unsealed sample exhibiting significant background variations due to sample evaporation an to bleaching of impurities during the measurements (likely on the coverglass). These plots are produced by the command
\texttt{dplot(d, timetrace\_bg)} after the background has been estimated. Each data point in these figures is computed for a 30~s time window.
