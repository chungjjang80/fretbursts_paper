\label{fig:bg_timetrace} Background rate as a function of time for two measurements Âµs-ALEX measurements (a) and (b) 
and different photon streams. In plot (a) the decrease in donor channel background is probably imputable to bleaching of impurities during the measurements (likely on the coverglass). In plot (b) the increase in background is due to sample evaporation. Plots are produced by the command
\texttt{dplot(d, timetrace\_bg)} after the background has been estimated. Each data point in these figures is computed for a 30~s time window.
