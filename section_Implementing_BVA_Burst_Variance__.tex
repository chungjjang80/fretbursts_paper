\section{Implementing BVA}


Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) is the method for single molecule FRET experiments, which has developed to detect molecular dynamics~\cite{Torella_2011}. It has been successfully implemented to identify whether heterogeneities in molecular structures caused by dynamic or static processes in millisecond time scale~\cite{Torella_2011}\cite{Robb_2013}.
