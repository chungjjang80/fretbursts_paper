\section{Implementing BVA}


Burst Variance Analysis (BVA) is the method which has developed to detect molecular dynamics in millisecond time scale in single molecule FRET experiments~\cite{Torella_2011}. It has been successfully implemented to identify whether heterogeneities in molecular structures caused by either dynamic or static processes in several papers~\cite{Torella_2011}\cite{Robb_2013}.
